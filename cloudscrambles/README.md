# cloudscrambles module

This is a proof-of-concept for deploying a TNoodle scramble API to the cloud.
It uses the models defined in `tnoodle-server` to provide basic functionality like querying scrambles REST-style.

The package structure is similar to `webscrambles`, except that other routes are being installed.
